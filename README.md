## Purpose

The purpose of this README is to explain the function of the multi-choice quiz, along with the features that meet the acceptance criteria.

# Password Generator

The objective of this assignment, as per the readme, is to create an application that allows the user to play a multiple-choice quiz. The application uses APis

## User Story
Make a multiple-choice qui

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
When the start quiz button is clicked, it initiates a series of multiple choice questions, with points deductions for low incorrect answers, and time is subtracted from the clock. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. When the game is over, the user can save their initials and their score.

Technically this meets the acceptance criteria if one takes it quite literally, but I was ultimately unable to get the data from local storage to appear on the linked html page, though it does show in the application on the browser.

## Notes

This was a tough one, and when I resubmit this homework it will probably look entirely different. 

I am less concerned with the grade I receive for this one, and would be delighted to hear any feedback that you might have in terms of simplifying the task, especially with regard to getting the content saved in local storage to display on a second screen - I'm close on this one, but I just can't seem to work through it.

## Contributing
I will be providing the url for the site via the github repository, and it can also be found here: https://mcnaryj.github.io/McNary-Homework-4/ however any pull requests are welcome.
